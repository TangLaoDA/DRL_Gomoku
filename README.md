# DRL_Gomoku
Deep reinforcement learning algorithms for Gomoku.
I think you must know alphaGo and alphaZero,it is implemented through deep reinforcement learning algorithm.
We implement and train an agent to play Gomoku.
I plan to use DQN,PG,A3C,DDPG to implement this agent,but I am too busy,so i just implement the version of DQN,in the days to come,
I will Complete the rest，if you are interested in it,you can Complete some of the rest,or optimize the version of DQN,the DQN has 
many enhanced version such as "Double DQN","Dueling DQN",and the strongest one:"RainBow".
If you want to exchange ideas with me，you can add me to WeChat:zggcdbd.
